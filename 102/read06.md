**Foreground color**
In CSS we can add a color of text inside an element, so we have 3 ways to specify any color. 
1. RGB Values: this way related to how many colors (red, green, and blue )are used to make it up 
Example :(100,100,90)

2. Hex Codes: these are six-digit codes that give a color preceded by a hash

3. Color names:- we have 147 colors 

Background color:- as usual most browsers have a white background. We can use (background-color) property on the body element 

We have in CSS something called “HSL Colors “ it is a way to specify colors by using hue, saturation, and lightness values 
Hue: is the colloquial idea of color, and it represents as a color circle 
Saturation:- is the amount of gray in a color, and it represents as a percentage 
Lightness: is the amount of white or black in a color

**Function methods & objects**
- Function declaration: is to create a function you give it a name then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces 
Function then Function name then (statement) then code block must be in curly braces 
Most functions are likely to consist of more statements 

-Calling A Function : is when you can execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code
Function name followed by parenthese then code

- Declaring functions that need information 
We use it when you have specific information. We put between parentheses something called parameters 
Function
