React of events:-
A script should run when a specific event has occurred . Before start writing a script you need to put all your goal and list the tasks to achieve it Then, you want to design the script. You can spill the goal into a series of tasks that are going to be involved . Then, you should start writing in a programming language.
A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task programmatically.
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
There are two types of expression, The first is an expression that just assigns a value to a variable and the second is an expression that uses two or more values to return a single value. 
There is something called operators. Expression rely on it and they allow programs to create a single value from one or more values 
Javascript contains different mathematical operators such as 
- Addition (+)
- subtraction (-)
- division (/)
- multiplication (*)
- Increment (++)
- decrement (--)
- modulus (%)
