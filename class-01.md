The HTML code is made up of letters that live inside angled brackets, and these are called HTML elements. 
HTML elements are made up of two tags the first is an opening tag, The second is The closing tag. 
The information between the opening and closing tag is the order that the browser will do it. 

Opening tag is like :-  < character >
