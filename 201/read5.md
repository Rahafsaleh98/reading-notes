Then write src it's an abbreviation of the source which relative to the URL

Usually, developers need to put a text description for images, so they can use alt,also if they need to put title for the image they can use title attribute 

> Developers can control the size of images through height and width 
**Where can we put the images in our code?** 

*As a developer, you can put the images in 3 places in the code* 

- before a paragraph 
- inside the start of a paragraph 
- in the middle of a paragraph 
> There is an attribute that calls align. Align is use to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image. It can be either left or right for horizontally, and top, middle, or bottom for vertically
