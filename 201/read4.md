*Chapter 4 “Links"*

Links allows developers to navigate from one website to another 

**How we can writing links?**
- opening tag then letters “a” then href = “ link” closing tag text then closing link tag 

>We can add Email links from malito 
> It allows users to put email addresses.

If the developers need to open a link in a new window they can use “ target



*Chapter 15 “layout”*

CSS treats each HTML 2 boxes, it can be either 
a block-level box or inline box


> Block level :- start on a new line like h1 tag, p tag, ul tag , and li tag 

> Inline elements :- flow in between surrounding text such as img tag, b tag , or I tag 
Continuing elements :- 
When one block elements inside another

CSS has something called positioning schemes, this allows to control the layout of a page, and developers can also use position property in CSS 

- normal flow :- each block-level show on a new line 
- Relative positioning :- it can use it to control of the element to the top , right , bottom , or left
- Absolute positioning:- it's related to the heading, in this case heading will appear on the top right of the page 

> Box offset properties are used to indicating where the box should be positioned 

> normal flow:- each block-level will appear on the top of the next one 

> relative positioning:- it moves an element about where it 

> fixed positioning:- it is a category of absolute positioning that needs the position property to have a value of fixed 

Screen sizes:- each visitor to the site, will have a different sized screen, so developers must work on different sized screens.


1. Screen resolution:- it's referred to the number of dots. It depends on the type of device. All systems allow putting the resolution of the screen
2. Page size:- most web designers usually use from 960-1000 pixels wide
3. Fixed width layouts:- it fixed width layout design, do not changes any size.
4. Liquid layouts:- it user increases or decrease the size , and they use percentages

**CSS Frameworks** 

*What is the aim of frameworks?* 
> it makes life easier by providing the code for common tasks



 *Chapter 3 “Functions, methods & objects “*

**What is a function?**

> Functions are a group of statements together to perform a specific task.
 
**How we can declare a function!**  
To create a function, you write the function keyword the function name then code in curly braces

**How we can calling a function?** 

First declared the function, then execute all the statements with just one line of code and this is known as calling the function 

Declaring functions that need information 
Many times, the function should have specific information to perform its task 

*Functions can be as a value or as a variables*

Getting a single value out of a function 
> some functions return information to the code that called them. 

Getting multiple values out of a function 
> function can return more than value using an array


 *Link:-*
Programming commonly involves two roles:- 
The driver:- is the programmer who is typing 
The Navigator:- it guides the driver but does not provide any input to the computer 


Pair program touches on all four skills 
> developers explain out loud what the code should do
> Listen to others’ guidance 
> Read code that others have written 
> Write code themselves

Why pair program? 
1. Greater efficiency 
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
