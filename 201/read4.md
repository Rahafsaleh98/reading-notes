*Chapter 4 “Links"*

Links allows developers to navigate from one website to another 

**How we can writing links?**
- opening tag then letters “a” then href = “ link” closing tag text then closing link tag 

>We can add Email links from malito 
> It allows users to put email addresses.

If the developers need to open a link in a new window they can use “ target



*Chapter 15 “layout”*

CSS treats each HTML 2 boxes, it can be either 
a block-level box or inline box


> Block level :- start on a new line like h1 tag, p tag, ul tag , and li tag 

> Inline elements :- flow in between surrounding text such as img tag, b tag , or I tag 
Continuing elements :- 
When one block elements inside another



 *Chapter 3 “Functions, methods & objects “*

**What is a function?**

> Functions are a group of statements together to perform a specific task.
 
**How we can declare a function!**  
To create a function, you write the function keyword the function name then code in curly braces

**How we can calling a function?** 

First declared the function, then execute all the statements with just one line of code and this is known as calling the function 

Declaring functions that need information 
Many times, the function should have specific information to perform its task 

*Functions can be as a value or as a variables*

Getting a single value out of a function 
> some functions return information to the code that called them. 

Getting multiple values out of a function 
> function can return more than value using an array


 *Link:-*
Programming commonly involves two roles:- 
The driver:- is the programmer who is typing 
The Navigator:- it guides the driver but does not provide any input to the computer 


Pair program touches on all four skills 
> developers explain out loud what the code should do
> Listen to others’ guidance 
> Read code that others have written 
> Write code themselves

Why pair program? 
1. Greater efficiency 
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
