Comparison operators ( Evaluating condition ) 
In Java, develops could evaluate a situation by comparing one value to what it might be 
Results will shown as “ True or false “ 
1. == ( is equal to )
2. != ( is not equal to ) 
3. === ( strict equal to )
4. ! == ( strict not equal to ) 
5. > ( grater than)
6. < ( less than)
7. >= ( greater than or equal to )
8. <= (less than or equal to )

Logical operators:- allow developers to compare the results of more than one comparison operator 
Here are some types:- 
1. && ( logical and ) This tests more than one condition 

2. || ( logical or ) This tests at least one condition 

3. ! (logical not) This take a single Boolean value and inverts it 
Note: logical expression is evaluated left to right

We have something called “ loops “ 
Loops check a condition, if the condition True it will run again until the condition returns False 
We have three types of loops:- 
1. For: it is the most commonly used, use it if you need to run code a specific number of times. 

2. While: use it if you do not know how many times the code should run.

3. Do While: It always run the statements inside the {} at least once.
